# Ink Wet

Ink Wet, referred to as `inkwet`, is a python library to fit my specific use case needs.  These are, in no particular order:

- A comprehensive 2D layer (lol)
- Best practices SVG export
- Bitmap export
- Intelligent curves
- Node support (a la Node Box)
- Optimization algorithms
    - Distributed optimization
- Primitive Shapes
- Laser cutter and Vinyl cutter sensitivity
- SCAD support?
- Font support (this is done, woohoo)
- Lots more

## Motivation

I use python to generate designs for 2D fabrication.  For example, laser cutters or vinyl cutters.  I cover this topic in my PyCon 2016 talk "[Laser Cutters, 3D Printers, and Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwL-ncEr-_I)".  Check it out for more information.

When I approach a new design, I find myself reinventing the wheel and repeating myself.  This library will be a focal point for these use cases with the goal of making richer and fuller computational designs with explicit design intent. 

## The name is ... weird?

When I name a new open source project, I roughly follow these priorities:

1) non-offensive (this is not difficult)
2) unique (search google, pip, other language libraries, products, company names, trademarks, etc).
3) consistent (`unicorn_dynamite` is rarely appropriate)
4) easy (short is sweet)
5) fun (fun to type, for example)

## Halp (me)

Do you enjoy constructing 2D designs from python?  Want a general purpose toolkit?  Step up, and lend me your code.  If this project grows large enough, I will also need a co-maintainer.
